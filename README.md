### CSS and HTML Projects

- [lab-css-yumyum](https://github.com/esmartdie/lab-css-yumyum)  
This project focuses on creating a responsive webpage for a recipe site based on a provided design. The main goal is to practice HTML/CSS integration with a "mobile-first" approach. The body uses the "Lato" font, and the headings use the "Intro" font. Images are provided for use within the page.  

- [lab-css-spotify-clone](https://github.com/esmartdie/lab-css-spotify-clone)  
This repository contains a clone of Spotify's user interface. The goal is to replicate the design using only HTML and CSS, focusing on layout and visual structure, making it an advanced CSS exercise.  


- [lab-css-ironskydive-2](https://github.com/esmartdie/lab-css-ironskydive-2)  
In this project, a website for a skydiving school is built to practice CSS skills. It emphasizes using custom fonts and images to create a visually appealing, responsive site for both mobile and desktop views.  

- [lab-html-ironskydive-1](https://github.com/esmartdie/lab-html-ironskydive-1)  
This project focuses on building the HTML structure for the same skydiving school website before applying CSS. The main aim is to develop a well-structured and semantic HTML page following best practices.  

### Java Projects

- [lab-java-add-and-update](https://github.com/esmartdie/lab-java-add-and-update)  
This lab focuses on data management in Java. Students must implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in a Java application using data structures and object-oriented programming principles.  

- [lab-java-intro-to-spring-boot](https://github.com/esmartdie/lab-java-intro-to-spring-boot)  
This project introduces Spring Boot, a popular framework for building Java-based web applications. Students learn to create simple APIs, handle HTTP requests, and configure applications.  

- [lab-java-modeling-complex-relationships](https://github.com/esmartdie/lab-java-modeling-complex-relationships)  
This lab focuses on modeling complex relationships between Java classes, such as inheritance, association, and composition. It's crucial for understanding how to structure more advanced Java applications.  

- [lab-java-intro-to-jpa](https://github.com/esmartdie/lab-java-intro-to-jpa)  
In this project, students are introduced to JPA (Java Persistence API), a standard for object-relational mapping in Java. It covers configuring JPA, managing entities, and performing operations on databases.  

- [lab-java-sql](https://github.com/esmartdie/lab-java-sql)  
This lab combines Java with SQL. Students learn to execute SQL queries from a Java application, practicing database connections, query execution, and result processing.  

- [lab-java-exceptions](https://github.com/esmartdie/lab-java-exceptions)  
This repository focuses on exception handling in Java. Students implement error-catching mechanisms to ensure that Java applications are robust and handle errors effectively.  

- [lab-java-interfaces-and-abstract-classes](https://github.com/esmartdie/lab-java-interfaces-and-abstract-classes)  
This lab teaches the difference between interfaces and abstract classes in Java, fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming. Students implement examples that highlight when and how to use each.  

- [lab-java-loops-and-version-control](https://github.com/esmartdie/lab-java-loops-and-version-control)  
In this lab, students practice using loops (for, while) and version control with Git in Java applications. The goal is to consolidate basic control flow concepts and best practices in source code management.  

- [lab-java-standard-input-and-classes](https://github.com/esmartdie/lab-java-standard-input-and-classes)  
This project focuses on handling standard input in Java and creating classes. Students develop applications that interact with users through the console and manage data input.
